## What is Switchback for Kodi?

Kodi utility for fast switching between recently played media.

Available from the Kodi official repository (i.e. don't install from here - just go to Add-ons -> Get Add-ons -> Services -> Switchback)

Keeps a list of recently played media - supports Kodi Addons, library episodes & movies, PVR (live & recordings), and non-library videos.  

The primary intended use is to make for super easy Switchback between two in progress video.

Consider this scenario:

- You're watching 'video A' with your partner.  You're interrupted, and your partner needs to tend to the kids/howl at the moon.
- You navigate to 'video B' and watch some of that while you're waiting.
- Your partner comes back.
- You hit your one button 'Switchback' and 'video A' instantly starts playing again -> no need for tedious navigation etc.
- You're interrupted, again! The moon really _is_ so very bright tonight. Hit your 'Switchback' button to instantly resume 'video B', again with no tedious navigation.

## Using Switchback

Switchback can be used like a standard Video plugin, via context menu, or bind a remote/keyboard key for instant Switchback, e.g.:

`<z mod="ctrl">PlayMedia(plugin://plugin.switchback/?mode=switchback,resume)</z>`
`
..or to show the full current Switchback list of recently played items:

`<x mod="ctrl">RunAddon(plugin.switchback)</x>`
